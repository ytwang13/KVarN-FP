# KVarN-MLA build status (local mla-experiment branch — DO NOT push)

Goal: extend KVarN to quantize the DeepSeek MLA compressed latent (kv_lora_rank
dims) + keep the decoupled RoPE part fp16. Dev model: DeepSeek-V2-Lite
(kv_lora_rank=512, qk_rope_head_dim=64, 27 layers, 64-expert MoE).

## Run prerequisites on this box (sm_120 / Blackwell)
- `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=TRITON_MLA`  (FlashInfer/FlashMLA fail arch check)
- `VLLM_DISABLE_FLASHINFER_ROPE=1`     (env-gate added to deepseek_scaling_rope.py;
  FlashInfer rope JIT fails on sm_120 -> use native PyTorch rope)
- `kernel_config={'moe_backend':'triton'}`  (MoE kernels)
- `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0`, `trust_remote_code=True`, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`

## Validated (real, tested)
- ACCURACY (probe): round-trip rotate->sinkhorn->RTN->dequant->unrotate on the
  512 latent in MLACommonImpl.forward_impl (env KVARN_MLA_BITS). bits=4 AND
  bits=2 keep V2-Lite coherent+correct. -> method works on MLA latents.
  Files: kvarn/mla_probe.py + forward_impl hook (mla_attention.py ~line 618).
- CKPT1 savings: packed 512-latent k4 = 402 B/token vs 1152 fp16 = **2.87x**
  (k2 ~4.3x). RoPE-fp16 (128B) is the floor. round-trip cos 0.9997.
- CKPT2 Triton dequant kernel (D=512, V-style, channel-major pack): cos 1.0 vs
  PyTorch ref, max_abs 1.4e-6, runs on sm_120. (/tmp/triton_kvarn_mla_test.py)
  Note: KVarN's existing `_kvarn_dequant_blocks_kernel` is D-parameterized and
  also usable at D=512.

## Design (key decisions)
- Latent stored ROTATED (c_KV @ H, H = orthonormal Hadamard-512). Rotation
  invariance: scores q_a.c = (H q_a).(H c); output = H^T (sum w_i (H c_i)).
  => FUSED path: rotate absorbed-query by H once/step, kernel uses rotated
  latent directly (per-token cost = dequant only, no per-token matmul),
  un-rotate the output once/step (or fold H^T into W_UV). MATERIALIZE path:
  just dequant+unrotate to fp16, feed stock attention (no query/output change).
- MLA quirk: V == K == the latent. The grouped MLA kernel loads K once and
  (IS_MLA) reuses it as V -> only ONE dequant load to add.
- Injection slot: triton_decode_attention.py `_fwd_kernel_stage1_grouped`,
  the K load ~line 364 (next to the existing fp8 dequant path ~line 371-372,
  which is the precedent: load quantized + multiply by scale).
- RoPE (qk_rope_head_dim=64) kept fp16, loaded as today (kpe ~line 376).

## Remaining build
### 3a MATERIALIZE (working + measurable first)
1. cache_dtype `kvarn_mla_k4_g128` (+k2); register cache.py + torch_utils.
2. Packed MLA spec: head_size -> packed bytes (256 latent + scales + 128 rope).
   page_size from packed bytes (mirror TQ/MLA spec; see attention.py MLA spec).
3. KVarNMLABackend(MLACommonBackend)/Impl(MLACommonImpl): override
   get_kv_cache_shape (packed), do_kv_cache_update (rotate+sinkhorn+RTN+pack
   store), forward_impl decode (gather attended blocks -> ckpt2 dequant kernel
   -> unrotate -> fp16 scratch in MLA layout -> stock TritonMLA attention).
   Hard part: paged gather + block-table remap into the fp16 scratch.
4. Backend selection: route kvarn_mla_* + use_mla -> KVarNMLABackend.
   (MLA selection is NOT the cuda.py list; it's the use_mla path.)
5. Validate vs fp16 baseline on V2-Lite; measure num_gpu_blocks (savings) + tok/s.

### 3b FULLY FUSED (peak speed, after 3a works)
- Modify `_fwd_kernel_stage1_grouped`: replace fp16 K-load with packed-load +
  in-loop dequant (ckpt2 logic) using rotated latent; add query rotation by H
  before the kernel + output un-rotation after (or fold into W_UV at
  process_weights_after_loading). No fp16 materialization.
- Validate numerics vs 3a; measure peak tok/s.

## Honest status
Method + savings + dequant kernel = proven. 3a/3b = substantial multi-session
vLLM-MLA integration + kernel surgery (paged cache, block tables, spec,
backend, selection, then fused attention). Resume from here.

## Overnight findings (morning summary)

VALIDATED PRIMITIVES (all real, tested on sm_120):
- Per-token Hadamard+RTN quant of the 512-latent (mla_quant.py): record=388 B
  vs 1152 fp16 = **2.97x**, latent cos 0.9921, RoPE exact. Streaming (no pool),
  and CUDA-graph-safe (matmul/min-max/round/bitops only — no Sinkhorn host-sync).
- Triton dequant kernel D=512 (ckpt2): cos 1.0 vs ref.
- Accuracy probe (Sinkhorn path): coherent at 4/2-bit (enforce_eager only —
  Sinkhorn's iterative ops break CUDA-graph capture; per-token path avoids this).
- BASELINE V2-Lite MLA burst (FP16, cudagraph): **3080 tok/s, cap 1,858,368 tok**.

KEY REGIME FINDING (why a burst SPEED win isn't visible here):
- MLA's latent cache is already tiny (1152 B/token), so on small V2-Lite the KV
  capacity is enormous (1.86M tok) — the burst (~147k tok) is nowhere near
  memory-bound. KVarN-MLA's ~3x savings raises capacity to ~5.5M but that does
  NOT raise throughput when not capacity-bound; materialize would only add
  dequant overhead. Same lesson as standard KVarN: capacity->throughput only in
  the memory-bound regime (large MLA model / very long context). Those (V3/V4,
  600B+) don't fit on 2x sm_120, so a burst speed WIN can't be demonstrated on
  this box. What we CAN show here: end-to-end correctness + real capacity (savings).

REMAINING BUILD (materialize backend) is genuine multi-session vLLM-MLA
integration (cache spec + packed layout + store hook + paged decode + selection)
— do_kv_cache_update is defined on the MLA impl base; the decode reads the paged
cache via the attention kernel (gather/dequant or fused). Not reliably
landable unattended overnight, and would not show a speed win on V2-Lite anyway.

RECOMMENDATION: the honest result is "KVarN-MLA works; ~3x latent compression;
speed win needs the fused kernel + a memory-bound regime (big MLA model)". For a
real speed number we'd want a large MLA model on enough GPUs, or accept the
correctness+savings result on V2-Lite.

## Update: FULL KERNEL SIDE VALIDATED (cos 1.0)
- Fused MLA-decode w/ in-kernel 4-bit dequant (kvarn_mla_attn_proto.py): cos 1.0.
- Paged version, shuffled block_table (kvarn_mla_paged_proto.py): cos 1.0.
  Packed record = [256 latent | 2 scale | 2 zp | 128 rope] = 388 B/token = 2.97x.
- v1: per-token RTN, NO Hadamard (accuracy refinement to add later).

## Remaining: BACKEND PLUMBING (the integration)
Crux: decouple cache-record-size (388 B) from compute-dims (kv_lora_rank=512 +
rope=64). vLLM MLA assumes spec head_size == compute head_size. Plan:
1. torch_utils: "kvarn_mla_k4_g128" -> torch.uint8 ; cache.py CacheDType.
2. MLA layer get_kv_cache_spec (mla_attention.py:973): for kvarn_mla_ ->
   MLAAttentionSpec(head_size=388, dtype=uint8) so page_size = block*388
   (2.97x more blocks). Keep self.kv_lora_rank/qk_rope_head_dim for compute.
3. KVarNMLABackend(TritonMLABackend): get_kv_cache_shape -> (nb, block, 388) uint8;
   get_impl_cls -> KVarNMLAImpl; supported_kv_cache_dtypes += kvarn_mla.
4. KVarNMLAImpl(TritonMLAImpl): override do_kv_cache_update (per-token RTN ->
   scatter packed 388-byte records at slot_mapping) + forward_mqa (call the
   validated paged kernel kvarn_mla_paged_proto). Prefill: use current fp16
   kv_c (no cache dequant) for single-chunk prompts.
5. Selection: route kvarn_mla_ -> KVarNMLABackend (cuda.py use_mla list + registry).
6. Validate V2-Lite end-to-end vs fp16; measure num_gpu_blocks (savings) + tok/s.
   Then V4-Flash on 2 GPUs (memory-bound -> where savings->speed should show).
Status: kernels DONE; plumbing = multi-hour iterative integration (head_size
decouple + store + forward_mqa + spec + selection + V2-Lite debug cycles).

## Update 2: PACKED CACHE WIRED IN vLLM (savings infra confirmed)
V2-Lite with kv_cache_dtype=kvarn_mla_k4_g128 now: passes dtype validation,
MoE(triton), rope, the head_dim/concurrency guards (excluded kvarn_mla from all
4 standard-KVarN startswith paths: cuda.py x2, gpu_worker pool, attention.py
spec, kvarn_attn.supports), and ALLOCATES the packed paged cache at the
compressed 388 B/token footprint (spec head_size=388, uint8). So the savings
machinery works end-to-end up to the store.

NEXT (the last 2 overrides — validated kernels are ready to plug in):
1. STORE: base AttentionImpl.do_kv_cache_update (vllm/v1/attention/backend.py
   ~L910/990) calls concat_and_cache_mla (C++) which writes dense [..,576] and
   FAILS on the packed uint8 [..,388] cache. Override for kvarn_mla: per-token
   RTN (mla_quant.pack_tokens) -> scatter 388-byte records at slot_mapping.
2. DECODE: TritonMLAImpl.forward_mqa -> call the validated paged kernel
   (kvarn_mla_paged_proto) instead of decode_attention_fwd. Prefill: current
   fp16 kv_c (single-chunk) -> no cache dequant.
Then: correctness vs fp16 on V2-Lite, burst (savings+speed), V4-Flash on 2 GPU.

EFFORT: store+decode override + numerical-correctness debug + burst + V4 is a
multi-hour iterative stretch. Everything HARD (3 kernels cos 1.0, savings 2.97x,
packed cache wired) is DONE; remaining is bounded plumbing on 2 methods.

## Update 3: END-TO-END WORKS + V2-Lite burst (the key result)
KVarN-MLA runs end-to-end on V2-Lite (fused decode kernel, correct output).
V2-Lite decode-burst (eager, in=16/out=4096, 32 seqs):
  FP16:       1756 tok/s, cap 1.71M
  KVarN-MLA:   691 tok/s, cap 5.08M  => SAVINGS 2.97x (matches theory!), SPEED 0.39x
Speed 0.39x = (a) v1 kernel unoptimized (per-(batch,head) serial loop, NO
KV-splits/BLOCK_N) + (b) V2-Lite not KV-bound.

## IMPORTANT CONCLUSION (value assessment)
MLA's entire purpose is a TINY KV cache (one ~512-dim latent/token, shared
across heads). So MLA models are essentially NEVER KV-capacity-bound — KV is
already minuscule vs weights/compute. Therefore KVarN-MLA's ~3x latent savings
has little to convert into throughput: there is no memory-bound regime to
exploit, while the in-kernel dequant ADDS per-token cost. Net: on MLA, KVarN
tends to be slower with capacity that isn't the bottleneck. (Contrast standard
attention, where KV is large and KVarN's capacity->throughput win is real.)
This is a feasibility SUCCESS but a VALUE-NEGATIVE result for MLA: the method
works + quantizes the latent losslessly-ish + 2.97x savings, but MLA already
solved the KV-size problem, so it rarely pays off. V4-Flash (149GB MoE) would
be compute/MoE-bound, not KV-bound -> same conclusion expected.
Caveat: an optimized kernel (KV-splits) would close the 0.39x toward ~1x, but
not produce a >1x WIN absent a KV-bound regime, which MLA structurally avoids.

## Update 4: kernel v2 (BLOCK_N tiling) + prefill gather + V4-Flash recon
- Decode kernel rewritten with BLOCK_N=32 token-tiling (was per-token serial).
  Standalone cos=1.0 vs fp16 ref. Record layout changed to 16-byte-aligned
  fields (kvarn_mla_layout(): NB, scale@au(NB), zp@+16, rope@+16, REC=au(...))
  so the gathered fp16 loads vectorize without misaligned-address faults.
  For V2-Lite (R=512,RP=64): REC=416 (was 388) -> 2.77x vs fp16's 1152.
- Added _kvarn_mla_gather_dequant_kernel + branch in _compute_prefill_context:
  unpacks the packed cache into the prefill workspace for chunked prefill
  (context_lens>0), replacing the C++ gather_and_maybe_dequant_cache that
  assumed fp8. Validates on long-prompt V2-Lite (chunked) [pending run].
- V4-Flash recon: it is a SPARSE MLA model (config has index_topk/index_n_heads
  =64/index_head_dim=128 -> NSA-style sparse attention), with PRE-QUANTIZED
  weights (quantization_config) and its OWN compression (hc_sinkhorn_iters,
  compress_ratios). head_dim=512, qk_rope_head_dim=64, num_kv_heads=1, 43 layers,
  256 experts. Sparse MLA uses SparseMLAAttentionImpl (decode-only forward_mqa),
  a DIFFERENT impl path than TritonMLAImpl where kvarn_mla is integrated -> V4
  needs separate sparse-impl integration. And sparse attention reads even fewer
  KV entries, so the "MLA KV not the bottleneck" conclusion is STRONGER for V4.

## Update 5: BLOCK_N=64 + V4-Flash is a separate sparse path (infeasible target)
- BLOCK_N sweep at burst shape (B=32,S=4096,H=16): bn16=1832us, bn32=1142,
  bn64=1048 (best), bn128=2163, bn256=7011. Set decode BLOCK_N=64.
- Chunked-prefill gather VALIDATED: V2-Lite 1300-tok prompt (3x512 chunks) ->
  kvarn_mla output IDENTICAL to FP16. Prefill path complete.
- V4-Flash is NOT a viable kvarn_mla target without major dedicated work:
  * arch DeepseekV4ForCausalLM uses DeepseekV4SparseMLAAttentionImpl (sparse
    indexer SparseAttnIndexer + top-k + compressor state cache + flashmla_sparse
    backend) -- a SEPARATE impl from TritonMLAImpl where kvarn_mla lives.
  * KV cache is HARDCODED fp8 sparse; config forces kv dtype "deepseek_v4_fp8".
  * flashmla_sparse backend: sm_120 support doubtful.
  * Sparse top-k attention reads even FEWER KV entries -> capacity savings matter
    even less. Structurally reinforces the value-negative conclusion for MLA.
  => V4-Flash would need a full sparse-MLA + indexer + compressor kvarn rewrite,
     out of scope. Documented as future work; not attempted further.

## FINAL V2-Lite numbers (best config: BLOCK_N=32)
| V2-Lite decode-burst, eager, 32 seqs | tok/s | vs FP16 | KV cap | vs FP16 |
| FP16                                  | 1718  | 1.00x   | 1.71M  | 1.00x   |
| KVarN-MLA v1 (per-token serial)       |  691  | 0.39x   | 5.08M  | 2.97x   |
| KVarN-MLA v2 (BLOCK_N=32 tiled)       | 1131  | 0.65x   | 4.74M  | 2.77x   |
Kernel optimization: 691->1131 tok/s = 1.64x kernel speedup (0.39x->0.65x FP16).
Capacity dropped 2.97x->2.77x from 16-byte field alignment (REC 388->416); the
alignment is what lets the v2 gathered fp16 loads vectorize. Net win: +64% speed
for -7% capacity. Still <1x speed: V2-Lite is not KV-bound (MLA KV already tiny)
+ FP16 path uses the highly-tuned split decode kernel. KV-splits would help
single-stream latency but not this high-occupancy burst (B*H=512 programs).

## Update 6: V4-Flash is hardware-blocked on this sm_120 box (3 independent reasons)
Empirical probe results (TP=2, 149GB fp8 weights DID load + sparse backend init'd):
  1. kv_cache_dtype=auto -> AssertionError "DeepseekV4 only supports fp8 kv-cache
     format" (V4 hardcodes fp8 KV; kvarn_mla cannot apply without sparse rewrite).
  2. kv_cache_dtype=fp8 -> ValueError "Mxfp4 MoE backend 'TRITON' does not support
     the deployment configuration since kernel does not support current device
     cuda". V4's MoE is MXFP4-quantized; NO MoE backend supports MXFP4 on sm_120.
  => V4-Flash cannot even load NATIVELY on this Blackwell-consumer box, regardless
     of KVarN. A V4 kvarn burst here is infeasible (hardware + separate sparse path
     + hardcoded fp8 KV). Needs a data-center GPU (H100/B200, sm_90/sm_100) AND a
     sparse-MLA kvarn integration. Documented as future work.
