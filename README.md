<h3 align="center">Variance-Normalized KV-Cache Quantization for vLLM</h3>



> ⚡️ **Built for agentic and long-context workloads.**

> 💡 KVarN delivers **3-5x more KV-cache capacity** and **up to ~1.3x the throughput** of FP16, so you fit far longer contexts and serve more concurrent requests on the same GPU, with FP16-level accuracy.

> 🔌 **Calibration-free, plug-and-play with vLLM.** A native vLLM attention backend: add one flag, no model changes, no calibration.

## Why KVarN?

KV-cache quantization usually comes with a catch. As the
[vLLM TurboQuant blog](https://vllm.ai/blog/2026-05-11-turboquant) shows, existing
methods buy extra KV-cache capacity but **give up throughput** (TurboQuant reports
**40 to 52% lower throughput** for 2.3-3.7x capacity), and aggressive low-bit
quantization also tends to **cost accuracy**. Losing both speed *and* quality is
the main reason KV-cache quantization is rarely turned on in production.

**KVarN is built to keep both.** On Qwen3-32B (AIME25, 16K-context burst, TP=2) it
matches FP16 accuracy and **beats its throughput** while delivering ~4× the KV-cache capacity:

</p>

KVarN stays in the upper-right corner the blog's methods can't reach: **FP16-level
accuracy, FP16-or-better throughput, and several times the context.**

## Quickstart

KVarN ships as a vLLM fork. Install it like vLLM, then select the KVarN KV-cache dtype.

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/huawei-csl/KVarN.git
cd KVarN

# 2. Install (uses the upstream precompiled wheel; KVarN kernels are Triton, JIT-compiled at runtime)
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 pip install -e .
```

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
    kv_cache_dtype="kvarn_k4v2_g128",   # enable KVarN
    block_size=128,                     # KVarN tile size
)
print(llm.generate("Explain KV-cache quantization in one sentence.",
                    SamplingParams(max_tokens=64))[0].outputs[0].text)
```

Serving works the same way:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-32B --kv-cache-dtype kvarn_k4v2_g128 --block-size 128
```

## How does KVarN work?

KVarN quantizes the KV cache one fixed-size token tile at a time, in three steps:

1. **Hadamard rotation** along the channel dimension. This mixes channels so that
   per-channel outliers are spread out, making the tile easier to quantize. The
   rotation is orthonormal, so attention scores are preserved.

2. **Iterative variance normalization** (Sinkhorn-like). Alternating column-wise
   and row-wise standard-deviation normalization in log space equalizes the
   variance across rows and columns of the tile. Balancing the tile this way
   shrinks the quantization error before any rounding happens.

3. **Asymmetric round-to-nearest** at low bit-width, with the scales folded back
   in at read time. Keys are quantized per channel, values per token.

The shipped preset spends **more bits on keys than values** (`kvarn_k4v2_g128`:
4-bit keys, 2-bit values). The reason is structural: key error propagates through
the `softmax(QK^T)` exponentials, while value error is averaged out by the softmax
weights, so keys carry most of the quantization sensitivity. The bit-widths are
fully parameterized internally, so other presets are easy to add.

---

## Roadmap

- Additional bit-width presets (the quantizer and kernels are bit-width generic).
- Variable page size (tile sizes other than 128).
- Broader model coverage and benchmarks.
